# About Us

The Kenya Informatics Foundation catalyzes a nationwide community of curious problem-solvers. We discover promising learners early, equip them with advanced informatics skills, and connect them with mentors and peers who share their passion for computing.

## Our Mission
We open doors for young Kenyans to thrive in algorithmic thinking and competitive programming. By combining rigorous instruction, hands-on practice, and exposure to global benchmarks, we help students translate raw potential into lasting confidence and achievement.

- Spot emerging talent in every region
- Deliver training camps, workshops, and digital learning resources
- Support teams on their journey from local contests to the IOI stage

## Our Vision
Kenya stands at the forefront of informatics education in Africa. We see classrooms where computational thinking is routine, educators who are empowered to guide advanced learners, and alumni who lead in technology, research, and entrepreneurship.

- Schools that champion computational literacy
- Students who compete — and win — internationally
- A community that reinvests expertise back into the country

## Core Values
Excellence shapes every program we run. Collaboration keeps us learning from educators, industry partners, and families. Inclusion ensures that resources reach talented students regardless of location or background. Innovation drives us to keep the curriculum fresh and relevant. Impact motivates us to turn competition success into lifelong opportunity.
